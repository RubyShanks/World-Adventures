# World-Adventures
A text based adventure game in C (incomplete)
In this RPG game we control a player with different stats and who can acquire various skills as their level progresses.
The player can fight monsters in a pokemon fashion. 
It is easy to add new types of monsters and also to add new types of skills.
Monsters are given some skills which are unique to each monster type.
Each skill and player/monster also has an element, creating the dynamic of elemental advantages and disadvantages.
We can create multiple characters and even have them battle each other. 
The aim is to create an adventuring world where literally anything is possible.
